//! Replay module.
//!
//! Provides functionality to replay a recorded scenario. In a real system the
//! scenario would be parsed and played back deterministically using the same virtual clock,
//! but here we provide a stub implementation.

use super::Simulator;

/// Replays a scenario from a given file path with the specified seed.
/// For demonstration, this stub simply runs the simulator with a fixed number of events.
pub fn replay_scenario(scenario_path: &str, seed: u64) {
    // In a full implementation, you would parse the scenario file here.
    println!("Replaying scenario '{}' with seed {}", scenario_path, seed);
    let mut simulator = Simulator::new(seed, false);
    // For this stub, we run 10 events.
    let state_hash = simulator.run(10);
    println!("Replay complete. State hash: {}", state_hash);
